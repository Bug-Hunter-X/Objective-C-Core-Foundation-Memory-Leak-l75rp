In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with Core Foundation objects.  Consider the following scenario: 

```objectivec
CFStringRef myString = CFStringCreateWithCString(kCFAllocatorDefault, "Hello, world!", kCFStringEncodingUTF8);

// ... some code ...

// Failure to release the CFStringRef
```

Failing to release the `CFStringRef` using `CFRelease(myString)` leads to a memory leak.  The garbage collector doesn't manage Core Foundation objects; manual memory management is crucial. This often occurs when developers forget to release objects in error handling blocks or after exceptions.
