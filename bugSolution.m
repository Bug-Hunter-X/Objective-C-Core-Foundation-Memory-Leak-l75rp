The solution involves explicitly releasing the `CFStringRef` using `CFRelease`.  Here's the corrected code:

```objectivec
CFStringRef myString = CFStringCreateWithCString(kCFAllocatorDefault, "Hello, world!", kCFStringEncodingUTF8);

// ... some code ...

CFRelease(myString); // Correctly releases the CFStringRef
```

This simple addition prevents the memory leak.  Proper memory management of Core Foundation objects is essential to prevent resource exhaustion and maintain application stability.
